These files contain characterization of samples provided by Prof. Carlos Basilio Pinheiro's group of MeMOF74, where Me stands for different metals (Mg, Zn, ...).

The data was acquired using a Witec Alpha 300 RAS microRaman system at the following configuration:

**Laser Wavelenght:** 532nm @ 1mW

**Grating:** 1800g/mm BLZ 500.00

**Spectral Center:** 1399.960 (for 1000-2000 cm-1 measurement set)

**Accumulations/Integration Time:** 200-400 acc. for 0.5s integration time (For 1000-2000 cm-1 measurement set)
                                    100 acc. for 0.5s integration time (70-3000 cm-1 spectral stitching measurement set)
                                    
**No spectral stitching is available for Au@Mg-MOF74 due to a high luminescence background**
